Letting a community solve a common problem like handling accounting affords you
so much additional time to focus on your domain and providing value to your
customers and that’s likely what you’re getting paid to do.

If you feel like you really need to write some accounting code, give back to
the library that you’re using. You can never have too much open-source software
and you can never have too many helpful people.
