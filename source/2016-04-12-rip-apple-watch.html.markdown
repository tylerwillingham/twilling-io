title: RIP Apple Watch

So, I bought an Apple Watch back in November. After just over five months of
ownership I've decided to leave it on the charger. I'm now wearing an entry-level
automatic mechanical dive watch. There are [plenty of us](https://marco.org/2016/02/05/watch)
who have gone from an Apple Watch to a mechanical watch.

I've had an interest in mechanical watches for a long time but I'm also enthusiastic
about new technology so I jumped on the Apple Watch. While it was okay, it felt
a lot more like a gimmick. A mechanical watch on the other hand (no pun intended)
impresses me to no end.

I'm in love with the engineering that allows a watch to operate without a battery.
The mechanics are endlessly impressive. I appreciate great engineering and I feel much more
appreciation for the details that go into building a mechanical watch. So, even
though it doesn't show me my text messages, I'm not looking ahead at the future
of smartwatches. I'll just look down at this old-fashioned, reliable timepiece.

Is this the single-responsibility principal manifesting in real life?
