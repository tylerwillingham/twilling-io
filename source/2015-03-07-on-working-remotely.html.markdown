title: On working remotely.

I recently had an injury resurface and I'm working from home for a prolonged
period of time. Here's what I like about it.

It's worth noting that I've worked from home for different periods of time before.
This isn't my first stint. I worked from home for a year during 2012-2013 and
before that when I was consulting full-time. So i've gotten used to the little
distractions and things that make it hard for some people during their initial
transition to full-time working from home.

My home workspace
-----------------

My favorite thing about working from home is getting to use my home office.
I have a dedicated office that I share with my girlfriend, however I'm basically
the only one that uses it. It's more comfortable than my work office because I
own everything, and I'm able to customize it knowing that I'm not going to be
moving it anytime soon.

Now if only I had bought that standing desk already...  

No morning commute
------------------

I like driving, but I don't like my morning commute. It's too short to really
enjoy my time in the car and traffic is really unpredictable. And in the morning
drivers tend to be worse than the evening since they're barely awake.

Cats
----

I work at a company where dogs are allowed in the office, but I'm a cat person.
Sometimes it's nice to take a minute and give your pet some attention.

Small breaks can become productive.
-----------------------------------

Sometimes at the office I'll get up and take a walk around the office and say
hi to people. It would feel odd if I did that at home. Instead my breaks at
home can consist of doing something small and thoughtless like cleaning the dishes.

Lunch
-----

I can cook lunch at home. Sometimes that just means heating something up in the
freezer and other times it means making an omellete for lunch. Either way,
it's cheaper because I already have the ingredients/food and it usually ends up
being faster than stepping out to grab a bite.

It's peaceful
-------------

Maybe not if you have children. But I don't. Now that it's starting to feel
like Spring I can crack the windows, have a slight breeze and it's quiet. I
don't have the background noise and distractions of a typical open office
environment.

No missed deliveries
--------------------

Maybe it's because I was feeling especially bored after-hours during my first
week in the house but I started buying several things off of Amazon and it was
really nice to know that I'm able to be here when it arrives and I don't have
to worry about delayed/missed deliveries.

Landlord visits/repair appointments
-----------------------------------

Our upstairs shower drain was leaking water which caused a wet spot in the
ceiling above our kitchen. Since I was working from home I was able to let the
repairman in and passively supervise my house while he did his thing

I'm enjoying working from home again. It's a nice break and while it will be nice
being in an office again, I think remote work is something I will always feel
passionately about.
